            California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates
            websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous
            privacy
            policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies

            Act)
        </p>
        <p data-line-start="175" data-line-end="176">When it comes to the collection of personal
            information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act
            (COPPA)
            puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States’ consumer protection agency, enforces
            the
            COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children’s
            privacy and safety online.</p>
        <p data-line-start="179" data-line-end="180">We do not specifically market to children

            networks or

        <p data-line-start="185" data-line-end="186">Fair Information Practices</p>
        <p data-line-start="189" data-line-end="190">The Fair Information Practices Principles
            form
            the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant
            role in
            the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice
            Principles
            and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal
            information.</p>
        <p data-line-start="193" data-line-end="194">In order to be in line with Fair Information
            Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</p>
        <p data-line-start="195" data-line-end="196">We will notify you via email</p>
        <p data-line-start="197" data-line-end="198">• Within 1 business day</p>
        <p data-line-start="199" data-line-end="200">We will notify the users via in-site
            notification
        </p>
        <p data-line-start="202" data-line-end="203">We also agree to the Individual Redress
            Principle
            which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors
            and
            processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable
            rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to
            investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>

            emails
            stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>
